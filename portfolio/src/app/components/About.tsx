          I build AI‑driven products and data tools that people actually use. My north star is
          Demis Hassabis&#39; vision—systems that learn, generalize, and make life better—applied to
          practical domains like compensation clarity and agriculture. My product bar follows
          Larry Page&#39;s toothbrush test: simple, habit‑forming tools that reduce friction and save time.
          I ship containerized services with CI/CD, observability, and tests, and I&#39;m comfortable
          owning work from design → implementation → review → deploy.
